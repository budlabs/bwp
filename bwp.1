.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCbwp\fR looks at the files in \fBBWP\_DIR\fP
(\fIdefaults to: \fB\fC\~/.cache/bwp\fR\fP) when selecting a
wallpaper. If \fB\fCbwp\fR is executed without any
arguments it will execute \fBBWP\_COMMAND\fP
(\fIdefaults to: \fB\fCfeh \-\-no\-fehbg \-\-bg\-fill\fR\fP) and
set the wallpaper to the the image that
\fBBWP\_DIR\fP/currentwall is linked to (*or choose a
random image from \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls if currentwall
doesn't exist*). The file \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/history
contains the wallpaper \fBhistory\fP\&. \fB\fC\-\-previous\fR
and \fB\fC\-\-next\fR can be used to set a wallpaper from
the history. \fB\fC\-\-random\fR will select a random
wallpaper from \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls . If the last
argument to \fB\fCbwp\fR is a file it will get copied to
\fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls and resized to the same
dimensions as the active monitor. If the last
argument is a name of a file in \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls,
that file will get used for further actions. When
\fB\fCbwp\fR is executed with the \fB\fC\-\-lock\fR option, it
will lock the computer using \fB\fCi3lock(1)\fR\&. When
locking, the selected image will be linked to:
\fBBWP\_DIR\fP/currentlock (\fIwhich is the file that
will be used as locksreen background if no
WALLPAPER argument is specified\fP).
