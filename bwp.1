.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB\fCbwp\fR looks at the files in \fBBWP\_DIR\fP
(\fIdefaults to: \fB\fC\~/.cache/wallpapers\fR\fP) when
selecting a wallpaper. If \fB\fCbwp\fR is executed
without any arguments it will execute
\fBBWP\_COMMAND\fP (\fIdefaults to: \fB\fCfeh \-\-no\-fehbg
\-\-bg\-fill\fR\fP) and set the wallpaper to the the

.PP
image that \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/currentwall is linked to
(*or choose a random image from \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls
if currentwall doesn't exist*). The file
\fBBWP\_DIR\fP/history contains the wallpaper
\fBhistory\fP\&. \fB\fC\-\-previous\fR and \fB\fC\-\-next\fR can be used
to set a wallpaper from the history. \fB\fC\-\-random\fR
will select a random wallpaper from
\fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls . If the last argument to \fB\fCbwp\fR
is a file it will get copied to \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls
and resized to the same dimensions as the active
monitor. If the last argument is a name of a file
in \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/walls, that file will get used for
further actions. When \fB\fCbwp\fR is executed with the
\fB\fC\-\-lock\fR option, it will lock the computer using
\fB\fCi3lock(1)\fR\&. When locking, the selected image will
be linked to: \fBBWP\_DIR\fP/currentlock (\fIwhich is
the file that will be used as locksreen background
if no WALLPAPER argument is specified\fP).
