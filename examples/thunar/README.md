# add a custom action to thunar

![demo](https://github.com/budRich/bwp/raw/next/examples/thunar/demo.gif)

One of the best features of the file manager [Thunar] are [custom actions].
By adding a custom action (`Edit -> Configure custom actions ...`) with the command:  

```
bwp %f
```

You can change wallpaper with bwp from within thunar, and if the image doesn't exist in the library it will be automatically added.
