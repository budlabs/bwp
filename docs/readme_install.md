If you use **Arch Linux** you can get **bwp**
from [AUR]. Use `make(1)` to do a systemwide
installation of both the script and the manpage.

(*configure the installation destination in the Makefile, if needed*)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/budlabs/bwp.git
$ cd bwp
$ make
# make install
$ bwp -v
bwp - version: 2019.08.24.10
updated: 2019-08-24 by budRich
```

[AUR]: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bwp/
